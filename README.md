A simple browser extension thattracks the time you spend on websites! It organizes data into daily and total time spent. It displays sites in order of total time, with the most frequently visited sites at the top and the least at the bottom. This includes browser-adjacent sites such as Keep! 

While it works as intended, the current UI isn't very appealing. Plans to enhance the UI are soon, but not soon enough!
